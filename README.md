## What's This?

An AJAX demonstration project from [frontendmasters's](https://www.frontendmasters.com)
intro to webdev course.

### Does it work?

Yes. It works but I will not guarantee that it will look good on all screens.

### Known Problems

- Images look very bad on mobile (have more height than width or worse lol)
> Yes I don't know how to make images properly responsive
- Loaded images push the `SPAWN A DOGGO` button down
> Layout is a headache
- ~~The page has a scrollbar~~
> ~~I have no idea why. I set the main elements by using percentages and it should
fit 100%. I gave up trying to fix it because it's going to take me hours or days xd~~
> Footer text was making a tiny weeny overflow in some browsers. Added some
padding at the bottom
